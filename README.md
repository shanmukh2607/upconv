# upconv

[upconv.c]/(https://github.com/shanmukh2607/upconv/blob/main/upconv.c) has the code for upconvolution computation (Needs to be simulated)

[conv2d.c]/(upconv/conv2d.c) has the code for pure convolution only (independent file), no need for simulation.

Remaining files are either data files or misc. C files. (Can ignore)
