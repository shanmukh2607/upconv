# Upconv

[upconv.c](upconv.c), [upconv_1.c](upconv_1.c), [upconv_2.c](upconv_2.c) have the code for upconvolution computation (Needs to be simulated)

[conv2d.c](conv2d.c) has the code for pure convolution only (independent file), no need for simulation.

Remaining files are either data files or misc. C files. (Can ignore)
